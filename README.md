# Machine_learning_lab2-project

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for "Machine Learning Lab 2 and data preparation for ML project on Alzheimer's disease" The exercises focus on practical data encoding techniques and the beginning steps in machine learning model preparation for project on AD classification.

### Exercises Included:
1. **Exercise 1:**
   - Implementation of label encoding for categorical data.
   - One-hot encoding applied to the region column in a dataset.
   
2. **Exercise 2: IoT Attack Detection with Danmini Dataset:**
   - Initial data exploration (data types, shape, and basic statistics).
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values).
   - Data scaling and normalization.
   - Data transformation (encoding numerical values).
   - Preparation for machine learning algorithm implementation.

3. **Project Phase 1 - Data Preparation:**
   - Comprehensive data description and cleaning techniques.
   - Detailed account of data normalization, scaling, and transformation methods.
   - Code is well-commented and explained for educational purposes.
